# Schedule Detail

### Session 1: Introduction to Bayesian Workflows

##### Learning Outcomes for the Session

  - Understanding of why data analysis / statistical / Bayesian Workflows are needed (i.e., current problems)
  - Basic understanding of how Bayesian Workflows aim to solve problems
  - Basic understanding of steps in workflow

##### What the Session will Cover

  - Practicalities of course
    - Details of the grading/assessment
    - Timing/schedules
    - Where to find more information and support
  - Relationship to prior BDA project tasks
    - Concepts/tasks from BDA which will be relevant
  - Possible datasets and modelling problems
    - For students without their own
  - Exploratory data analysis in Bayesian Workflow

##### Recommended Reading Before Session

  - Bayesian Workflow (Gelman, et al., 2020)
    - https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808

### Session 2: Choosing an Initial Model

##### Learning Outcomes for the Session

  - How to specify a research question that can be answered with a statistical model
  - Awareness of tools and methods to aid in exploring data and formulating question
  - Awareness of common/standard modelling approaches for different questions
  - Students should have decided on their research question and at least 1 initial model

##### What the Session will Cover

  - Using exploratory data analysis to support the choice of initial models
  - Common models and modelling approaches for common research questions
    - e.g., observational, randomised study, purely exploratory, based on theory
  - Literature and best-practices can also help with model development
    - Using either an example or a student's dataset/problem as an example

##### Recommended Reading Before Session

  - Iterative Model Building (Aki Vehtari)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppKpwtGy8KQ

### Session 3: Prior Choices

##### Learning Outcomes for the Session

  - Develop awareness of impact of mis-specified priors
  - Understanding of approaches for specifying prior (i.e., prior elicitation)
  - Understanding of tools/methods for diagnosing prior sensitivity

##### What the Session will Cover

  - How to turn assumptions/knowledge into prior
    - Generative priors, penalised complexity, etc.
    - Connection to model expansion/choice/selection goals
    - Brief coverage of different topics for prior choice
  - How to assess prior choice
    - If the type of prior / prior properties do not align, etc.
    - Prior predictive checks
  - How to revise/modify a prior (if needed)

##### Recommended Reading Before Session

### Session 4: Model Checking: Posterior Predictive Checks & Calibration

##### Learning Outcomes for the Session

  - Understanding role of predictive checks in model-checking
  - Understanding of impact of different data types on approach (e.g., continuous vs discrete)
  - Familiarity with different graphical methods and tools for supporting checking

##### What the Session will Cover

  - Detecting, resolving, and reporting:
    - Prior sensitivity
    - Posterior predictive checks
    - Calibration

##### Recommended Reading Before Session

### Session 5: Extending Models and Model Selection

##### Learning Outcomes for the Session

  - Understanding of how to extend a model to better address a research question, and if it is even needed
  - Understanding of how to select between different models, and whether this is necessary
  - Understanding of how to combine multiple models for increased performance

##### What the Session will Cover

  - Common methods for model expansion
    - Data-driven vs theory-driven
  - Common methods for model comparison, and interpreting the results of these
  - Alternatives to model selection
    - e.g., model averaging

##### Recommended Reading Before Session

### Session 6: Interpreting and Presenting Model Results

##### Learning Outcomes for the Session

  - Using model quantities and results to assess whether research question has been answered
    - Reflecting on how/if initial question has changed throughout workflow process
    - Reflection on possible alternative expansions for research questions/models
  - Presenting model results accessibly

##### What the Session will Cover

  - How to extract and prepare results
    - e.g., using R packages such as `tidybayes` and `marginaleffects`
    - Further analysis of interesting effects (interactions, smooths, etc.)
  - Prior sensitivity for final conclusions (quantities/choices not sensitive to priors)
  - Brief introduction to alternative methods for constructing and reporting alternative models
    - e.g., Multiverse analysis

##### Recommended Reading Before Session

### Session 7: Summary & Presentations

##### Learning Outcomes for the Session

  - Awareness of how workflow will differ between research questions
  - Reflection of how workflow contributed to analysis process
  - Reflection on future iterations of model
