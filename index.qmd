title: "Bayesian Workflows course"
---

This is the webpage for "CS-E407520 Special Course in Machine Learning and Data Science: Bayesian Workflows" - a seminar on Bayesian workflows at Aalto University targeted at master students and doctoral researchers. 

In this seminar, we dive into some of the essential steps of Bayesian modelling workflows. You will become familiar with available software tools that can support different aspects of modelling like prior sensitivity checks, choosing regularising priors or using model comparison and model averaging techniques. You will gain hands-on experience working with your own modelling problem.

### Prerequisites 

Successful completion of [CS-E5710 Bayesian Data Analysis](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/index.html) or otherwise previous knowledge in Bayesian data analysis on a similar level is required. 

The number of participants is limited to 30.
