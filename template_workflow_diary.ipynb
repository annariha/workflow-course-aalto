Each section of the template corresponds to a step in the workflow that you will applying, specifies a suggested minimum 'goal' that you should aim to complete. How you decide to implement the workflow steps and achieve these goals is completely up to you.\n",

This diary should be record of your learning and experience with each workflow step, and will evolve as you learn more about the Bayesian workflow. If there are any issues or questions that you have, please record them in the diary so that we can discuss them during the in-person seminar sessions.\n",
